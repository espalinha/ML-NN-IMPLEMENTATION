# ML-NN-IMPLEMENTATION
My own machine learning/neural network implementation library.
This is only for my own study 
This repository is inspired in the playlist of "Roman's Coding", https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzDkoEk_dpxoXlTDOIeDPxl83PprF2vKW.


# MACHINE LEARNING
Machine learning will be based on the book: "Learning from Data, Yaser S. Abu-Mostafa, Malik Magdon-Ismail, Hsuan-Tien Lin".
And it will have the mathematical and theoretical support of the book: "The Elements of Statistical Learning, Jerome H. Friedman, Robert Tibshirani and Trevor Hastie".

# NEURAL-NETWORK
The book used will be: "Neural Networks from Scratch in Python (2020), Harrison Kinsley, Daniel Kukieła - "
And it will have the mathematical and theoretical support of the book: "Deep Learning, Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville"

# Deep Learning 
The book used will be: "Deep Learning from Scratch, Seth Weidman"

And it will have the mathematical and theoretical support of the book: "Deep Learning, Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville"

# Linear Algebra
We will make a C++ linear algebra library, to do this we will use the book: "Fundamentals of Matrix Computations, second Edition, David S. Walkins".

The linear algebra is done in two parts, the API written in C++ and the implementation written in Fortran 90 and CUDA.

# Test Cases
The test cases will be done with the books: "Deep Learning With Python, François Chollet" and "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow, Aurélien Géron"

# Plotting
For plotting, this lib will use the ROOT library, from CERN, https://root.cern/
