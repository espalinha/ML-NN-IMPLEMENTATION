# ML-NN-IMPLEMENTATION
My own machine learning/neural network implementation library

# MACHINE LEARNING
Machine learning will be based on the book: "Learning from Data, Yaser S. Abu-Mostafa, Malik Magdon-Ismail, Hsuan-Tien Lin".
And it will have the mathematical and theoretical support of the book: "The Elements of Statistical Learning, Jerome H. Friedman, Robert Tibshirani and Trevor Hastie".

# NEURAL-NETWORK
The book used will be: "Neural Networks from Scratch in Python (2020), Harrison Kinsley, Daniel Kukie≈Ça - "
And it will have the mathematical and theoretical support of the book: "Deep Learning, Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville"

# Linear Algebra
We will make a C++ linear algebra library, to do this we will use the book: "Matrix Computations, Gene Golub".
